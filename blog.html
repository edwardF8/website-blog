                            Junior year has been pretty busy so far. Ill try to stay active with the blog, but again, this is all pretty much for fun. I recently got a 1950s Analytical Geometry book and I cant wait to learn it. I always loved drawing shapes+patterns as a kid but was always at Algebra rather then Geometry.
