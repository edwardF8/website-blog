                        Hi, My names Edward Friedman, and im a high school student from Maryland, USA. Im love physics and computer science, but im curious about anything tbh. All my freinds say I talk to much, so I decided to start a blog. I also need somethin to do when im too tired to study, so I guess this is like a side hobby, hopefully i learn some webdev in the meantime too.
