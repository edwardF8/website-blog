                        Hi, My name is Edward Friedman, and I'm a high school student from Maryland, USA. 
                        <br>I love physics and computer science, but to be honest I'm curious about anything and enjoy using the "academic" approach to any topic

                        <br>I also need something to do when I'm too tired to study, so I guess this is like a side hobby. Hopefully, I learn some web dev in the meantime too!
                        <br>I can't say I'll have the best grammar on here because again, I only work on this when I'm tired. 
                        
                        <br><br> Note 1:the name is a joke, i couldnt come up with a professional but fun name....
